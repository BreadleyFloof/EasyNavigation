# Information
I developed this mod in about 6 hours total. This is my first mod for a game, but I do have a lot of experience developing Unity games. I plan to clean the code up and add more features in the future.\
As for right now, the TrailRenderer does not have the HDRP/Lit shader and will show as pink. This is better for visibility as setting it to use the HDRP/Lit shader will make it blend into certain parts of the factory.\
The enable permanent trail bool variable defaults to "False" and does not display what it is currently set to.
